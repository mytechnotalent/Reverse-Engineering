High Score Application Requirements
-----------------------------------
1. Define the purpose of the application.
   a. Create a High Score application where you enter in a list of scores and use
      a for loop to find the highest score
2. Define the logical steps of the application.
   a. Create a str scores variable and input getting a list of numbers 
      separated by a space and when the user presses enter it will
      split each number based on the space into a scores list.
   b. Cast the entire list from a str list into an int list using a for 
      loop.
   c. Print the new int list.
   d. Create a highest_score variable and init to 0.
   e. Create a for loop where we iterate over each score and create a
      conditional to check if each score is greater than the hightest
      score and if it is then take that score value and assign it
      to the highest_score variable and keep iterating.  If we find
      another score that is bigger than the highest_score than 
      assign that new score to highest_score.
   f. Print highest_score var.
